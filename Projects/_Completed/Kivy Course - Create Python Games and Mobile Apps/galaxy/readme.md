Kivy is a free and open source Python framework for developing mobile apps and games with a natural user interface.

We just released a 5-hour Kivy course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. In this Kivy course, you will learn to create games and applications with Python for every platform (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android).

Jonathan Roux developed this course. Jonathan has created many courses on a variety of platforms.

First you will learn how to use the Kivy library. You will create graphical user interfaces with buttons, labels, and images. You will learn how to implement many kinds of layouts to create interfaces that can adapt to every screen size from desktop to mobile.

Then you will create a full game with Kivy and Python. The GALAXY project is a perspective game where you need to keep your spaceship on the track.
