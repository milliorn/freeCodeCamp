Coding a project is a great way to improve your Python skills. But why stop at one project? Why not go for an even dozen?

We've released a beginner's Python course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to build 12 different projects in Python.

Kylie Ying created this course. Kylie is a graduate student at MIT, a software engineer, and an experienced teacher.

Kylie will walk you through the implementation of 12 Python projects, in order from simplest to most complex. In each of these projects, you will learn about a new component of the Python programming language.

Here are the different projects you will build:

Madlibs
Guess the Number (computer)
Guess the Number (user)
Rock Paper Scissors
Hangman
Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe AI
Binary Search
Minesweeper
Sudoku Solver
Photo Manipulation in Python
