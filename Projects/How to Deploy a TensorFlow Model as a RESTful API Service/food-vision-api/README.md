# Food Vision Backend & Model

This project holds the back-end logic, and ML model used in the client-interface that can be found through this [link](https://food-vision-ruaro.herokuapp.com/). Moreover this, project is deployed to Heroku, using Docker. I also wrote an article on [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/deploy-an-ml-model-using-fastapi-and-docker/) on how to deploy a TensorFlow model as a RESTful API service using this project as its base.
